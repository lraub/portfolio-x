            <img src="img/testimonial-dibo-image.png"  alt="Diane Bowman" />
            <h5>Diane Bowman- Partner @ Spicefire <br> and Creative Director @ LPK</h5>
            <p>Lisa is a creative force — a designer with a strategic brain and an eye for beauty and finesse. She has that uncanny ability to take objectives from a brief and deliver amazing concepts, in a range that pushes and pulls ideas beyond the expected. Delivers equally well on the one-ofs up to complex architectures and design systems. Strong in beauty, food and many other categories, particularly in packaging, but also web and print.
              <br> Lisa is the consummate professional — deeply involved, tuned to team needs, able to own and deliver. Great follow-through and attention to detail.</p>
